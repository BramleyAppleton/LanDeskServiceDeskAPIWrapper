LANDESK Service Desk API Library

DESCRIPTION
This library wraps the Rest API for LANDESK's product "Service Desk" for use with your code. It handles authentication using a username and password you provide. It also aims at the LANDESK endpoint you indicate.

PURPOSE
Utilize this library to query your LANDESK "Service Desk" for items, make changes to items and save them. The library is incomplete, so please contribute your code if you add a feature which is not currently available through the API.

VERSIONING
This library is an open-source work in progress. As a result, it is important to pay attention to versioning of your installation to avoid unnecessary complications resulting form updates to the API.

WARNING
This library only wraps the REST API for you but because LANDESK's API is robustly designed, you must responsibly use this API when interacting with your service desk installation. This is an open source effort not affiliated with LANDESK.
